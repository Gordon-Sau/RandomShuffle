# random shuffle algorithm
Implement Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle algorithm to shuffle a sequence.
RandomSeqFromBigNum.py implements the algorithm with just one random number. It uses factorial to get random number j where 0<=j<=i from that one random number. Since factorial get large quickly, make sure the language supports big number, otherwise overflow would occurs.
